## Task 1: Conceptual Questions

It’s extremely important Create a list with the following questions:
1. What is the purpose of the lapply() function? What is the equivalent purrr function?
2. Suppose we have a list called my_list. Each element of the list is a numeric data frame (all columns
are numeric). We want use lapply() to run the code cor(numeric_matrix, method = "kendall")
on each element of the list. Write code to do this below! (I’m really trying to ask you how you specify
method = "kendall" when calling lapply())
3. What are two advantages of using purrr functions instead of the BaseR apply family?
4. What is a side-effect function?
5. Why can you name a variable sd in a function and not cause any issues with the sd function?
